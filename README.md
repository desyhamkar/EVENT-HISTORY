# SURVIVAL-ANALYSIS
Explore data with methodologies 

1. Introduction 
During the past ten years, numerous efforts have been formed to decrease the death rate among lung cancer patients. Afterall, the increasing in long-term survival has been limited and lung cancer is still a disastrous disease.
In our dataset we have data patients with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. It contains 228 records lung cancer patients. We have data including information about age, sex, ECOG performance score, Karnofsky Performance Scale , meal calories and weight loss of patients.

ECOG performance score which describes a patient’s level of functioning in terms of how well their ability to care for themself, perform usual daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.).
 
The Karnofsky Performance Scale Index is an assessment tool for functional impairment. It can be used to compare effectiveness of different therapies and to assess the prognosis (the chance of recovery or recurrence) in individual patients. In most serious illnesses, the lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the likelihood of survival.
